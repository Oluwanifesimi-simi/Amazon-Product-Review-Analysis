## Introduction

Assuming the role of a Junior Data Analyst at a fictional company named RetailTech Insights, I worked on a data set for my capstone project with DSA (The Incubator Hub).
As part of a data-driven project at RetailTech Insights, I analyzed a dataset of 1,465 Amazon products across various categories to uncover patterns in discounts, reviews, and ratings. The goal was to generate insights that inform product improvement, marketing strategy, and customer engagement.

## Key Metrics & Insights
🔑
•	✅ Average Discount by Category revealed top-discounting product lines and pricing strategies.

•	📦 **Product Distribution:** Categories like Electronics and Computers&Accessories dominated listings.

•	🌟 **Rating Distribution:** Majority of products had ratings of 4, with a few standout performers of 5 ratings.

•	🏷️ **50%+ Discount:** 51% of products had discounts of ≥50%, many of which were rated above average, with a slim line with undiscounted products returning 49% suggesting potential high performance of the products.

•	💬 **Review Volume:** Three (3) products had over 5,000,000+ reviews, driving visibility and buyers’ confidence.

•	💸 **Revenue Potential:** Calculated as Actual Price × Review Count, this exposed the top revenue-generating categories that are potentially doing well.

•	🔁 **Rating vs. Discount Correlation:** This analysis shows that most products with voluminous ratings have higher discounts.

•	🏆 **Top 5 Products:** Ranked by a composite of rating + review volume to highlight best-performing listings.

## Recommendation 
💡
**1. Improve Low-Performing Products Based on Customer Reviews**
Focus on enhancing the quality, features, or pricing of the bottom-rated products by addressing recurring customer complaints and feedback patterns identified in the reviews.

**2. Develop a Tiered Marketing Strategy Funnel**
Create a targeted marketing funnel that:

•	Amplifies visibility and conversion for the most-reviewed products (leveraging social proof and customer trust)

•	Boosts awareness and engagement for less-reviewed products through promotional campaigns, influencer outreach, and review generation strategies (e.g., follow-up emails or discounts for reviews).

## Tools Used
📊
•	Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables and Calculated Columns)

•	Custom Dashboards with KPI Cards, Slicers, and Visual Charts

## Outcome 
📈 Built a clean, interactive Excel dashboard to support decision-making around pricing strategies, inventory prioritization, and customer satisfaction trends.
